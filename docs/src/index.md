## Introduction

CODE.jl is a toolbox for Julia developers that offers advanced capabilities in code analysis, transformation, and generation. It is particularly useful for metaprogramming, creating domain-specific languages, and building dynamic code analysis tools.

## Installation

To install CODE.jl, open your Julia REPL and run the following commands:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("CODE")
```

## Features

### Analyze

The `Analyze` module provides tools to inspect Julia functions and other code objects at runtime. Key functionalities include:

- **argnames:** Extract the names of the arguments from a given function.
- **docstring:** Retrieve the documentation string associated with a function.
- **typeinfo:** Extract type information of the arguments and return type of a function.

### Transform

The `Transform` module allows for programmatic modifications of Julia code expressions. It includes capabilities such as:

- **modify_code:** Transform a given code expression programmatically.
- **apply_macro:** Apply a macro function to a given expression and return the transformed expression.

### Generate

The `Generate` module focuses on dynamically creating new Julia code. This includes:

- **generate_function:** Dynamically create a new Julia function.
- **create_dsl:** Assist in building domain-specific languages.
- **template_function:** Generate code based on predefined templates.

## Getting Started

Here is a simple example to get you started with CODE.jl:

```julia
using CODE

function greet(name)
    println("Hello, $name!")
end

argnames = CODE.argnames(greet)  # Get argument names
println(argnames)  # Output: [:name]
```

## Examples

For more detailed examples, please refer to the `examples` directory in the CODE.jl repository. These examples cover various use cases and demonstrate the practical applications of the package.
