**CODE.jl**

A Julia toolbox for code manipulation, introspection, and generation.

**Features**

* **Analyze:** Inspect functions and other code objects at runtime. Extract elements like argument names, docstrings, type information, etc.
* **Transform:** Modify code expressions programmatically. Build macros or functions that operate on other functions.
* **Generate:** Create new Julia code dynamically. Useful for code templating, auto-generating functions, or DSL (Domain-Specific Language) creation.

**Getting Started**

1. Install CODE.jl:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("CODE")
   ```

2. A simple use case:
   ```julia
   using CODE

   function greet(name)
       println("Hello, $name!")
   end

   argnames = CODE.argnames(greet)  # Get argument names
   println(argnames)  # Output: [:name] 
   ```

**Use Cases**

* **Metaprogramming:** Implement powerful macros and language extensions.
* **Dynamic Analysis:** Runtime code inspection and debugging tools.
* **Code Generation:** For automation tasks or creating specialized functions.
* **Educational:** Learn Julia internals and advanced language concepts.

**Caution**

CODE.jl provides tools to manipulate Julia code at its core. Exercise caution, as modifications to code can lead to unexpected behavior if not done carefully.

**Contribute!**

This project is open source and welcomes contributions. Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests.

**Disclaimer**

CODE.jl is still under development. The API and functionality may change in future releases.
